# Pants Attack - UI

This is a WebSocket Client meant to be hosted by [Pants Attack - Server](https://github.com/GreyloreNetwork/PantsAttack-Server) and must be its sibling for this hosting to occur.

Both projects are currently in development, targetting this [Design Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W4HN9tZU0Rr-BptcWVyNttY190e8BYvuhWDftgLVyx4).

## Setup

Run the following commands:
- `npm run install`
- `npm run build`

Then see the **Pants Attack - Server** project for further instructions on how to run the app.
